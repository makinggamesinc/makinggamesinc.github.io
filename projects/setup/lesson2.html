	<h1>Lesson 2: Running the command prompt</h1>
	
	<p>
		The command prompt (or terminal on mac) is our gateway to talking to the computer. Instead of using a GUI program (one with buttons & graphics), the command prompt let's us talk to the computer just using text. It's the things you see in hacker movies with text scrolling across the screen, black & white or an eiry green. But rest assured we won't be needing to hack into the pentagon to make our games!  We'll just be using a very simple command that will take our

		We'll just be using a very simple command that will take our text files that have our code in & turn them into an executable* that the computer can run. The command line can do a lot of things (everything & more you can do with the GUI), such as create new folders, create files, connect to the internet.
	</p>
	<p>
		Throughout your journey as a programmer, you'll pick up on some useful commands that make life easier for you. But you don't have to become a command line guru to become a great game programmer. 
	</p>
	<p>The command we'll be using is:</p>
		<div class="code-block">
			cl 
		</div>
	<br>
		<div class="code-block">
			gcc 
		</div>
	<p>
	So when we open up the command prompt on windows or on mac, terminal, will be greeted by some text & a blinking cursor. Now type the command from above & press enter. By pressing enter your saying to the command prompt - run this command. It will spew out some text, saying your useage isn't correct. This is because it expects to be passed a file to turn into a program. In our case it expects a file ending in .c or .cpp (for C code or C++ code respectively). So our job is to then create a file ending in .cpp (or .c) & run the command again, but this type followed by our file name.
	</p>

	<p>
		When we actually compile our file we will want to type the soruce code file name as well. 
		<br>
		Windows:
		<div class="code-block">
			cl ourFile.cpp
		</div>
		Mac & Linux:
		<div class="code-block">
			gcc ourFile.cpp
		</div>

	</p>

	<h3>Instructions:</h3> 
	<p>
		To open up the command prompt go to the search bar & type <b>command prompt</b> on Windows or <b>Terminal</b> on Mac.
	</p>
	<p>
		<h3>Windows</h3>
		<img class="example-image" src="/images/command.png"/>
		<br>
		<h3>Mac</h3>
		<img class="example-image" src="/images/terminal_open.png"/>
	</p>
	<p>
		Once open you'll be greeted by a window with a blinking cursor. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<h3>Windows</h3>
		<img class="example-image" src="/images/cmd_open.png"/>
		<p><i>What the <b>command prompt</b> looks like on Windows.</i></p>
		<br>
		<h3>Mac</h3>
		<img class="example-image" src="/images/terminal1.png"/>
		<p><i>What the <b>Terminal</b> looks like on Mac.</i></p>
	</p>
	<p>
		If you then type the command from above you'll get an error message.
	</p>
	<p>
		<h3>Windows</h3>
		On Windows you'll notice it doesn't recongise what <b>cl</b> means. This is because you need to do one extra step to get it working. This is a bit of an inconvienance, but <b>you only have to do it once on opening the command prompt</b>. From then on it will understand what <b>cl</b> means.  
		<br>
		<div>
		<img class="example-image" src="/images/cmd_cl_not_there.png"/>
		</div>
		To get it working you have to run the <b>vcvarsall.bat</b> file. You don't have to understand what this is by any means, you just have to run it to get access to the <b>compiler</b>. It's located in a different place depending on what version of Visual Studio you have. On the 2017 version you just copy this in and press enter:
		<div class="code-block">"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" x64</div>
		<p>
			If you're using a different version, the line you copy in will be slightly different. The best thing to do is google your year version of Visual Studio with <b>vcvarsall.bat</b>. Hopefully you'll find an answer, if not pop over to the discord channel & ask for some help. 
		</p>
		<hr>
		<img class="example-image" src="/images/cmd_run_script.png"/>
		<p>On running the vcvarsall.bat file, you'll see this message.</p>
		<img class="example-image" src="/images/cmd_no_file.png"/>
		<p>Now when we run our <b>cl</b> command, we should see this message.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Mac</h3>
		<p>Typing the command <b>gcc</b> in.</p>
		<img class="example-image" src="/images/terminal_gcc.png"/>
		<p>After we press enter, we'll see this message. </p>
		<img class="example-image" src="/images/terminal_nofiles.png"/>
		<p>This is saying it needs a file to convert to an executable*. This is the next step to getting a program up & running.</p>
	</p>
		
	<p>Phew! That was a big step, but well done. We now know what the command line is, and can run our compiler from it. Although this seems a lot at the moment, once we get into writing some programs, the process will become clearer & it will be a piece of cake. In the next <a href="/projects/hello-world.html">project</a>  we will actually write some real C++ code, & then compile it using the steps we outlined above.</p>

	<p>
		* - an executable is computer talk for a file that the computer is able to understand (i.e. machine code) & therefore execute what's inside it.
