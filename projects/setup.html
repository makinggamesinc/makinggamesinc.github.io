	<h1>Project: Setup & Installation</h1>
	<p>In this project we just setup our work environment. This involves installing the compiler (the thing that turns our code into a runnable computer program), & installing a text editor (to write our code!).</p>
	<p>By the end of this project you'll be able to:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Know how to donwload the compiler
			</li>
			<li>
				Know of different text editors & have downloaded one of them.
			</li>
			<li>
				Run the compiler from the command line. 
			</li>
			<li>
				The command & any extra steps to compile code 
			</li>
		</ul>
