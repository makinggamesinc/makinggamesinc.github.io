	<h1>Project: Text Adventure</h1>
	<p>In this project we'll write our first game, a classic text adventure game. Text adventures were one of the first video games & have a historic place both in computer game history & computer science history.</p>
	<div class="lesson-goals">
	<p>By the end of this project you'll be able to:
		<ol>
			<li>
				Learn about buffer overflows & how we can avoid them
			</li>
			<li>
				Learn about the <b>struct</b> type
			</li>
			<li>
				Add a <b>game loop</b> that will allow our program to keep running forever until the user quits 
			</li>
		</ol>

	<h2>Lesson 1: Writing the <b>entry point</b> to our program & setting up the basic structure</h2>
		<p>In this lesson we setup a new project, add the <b>main</b> entry point to our program, make use of the printf & scanf functions & add a while loop (commonly called the game loop) that will keep our program running. We will also implement our own string match function, to see if two strings equal each other.</p>

	<h2>Lesson 2: Replace scanf with fgets, write a function to remove newline characters & add Room data structure</h2>
		<p>In this video we continue with our text adventure. We start by replacing scanf with fgets since it is more memory safe. We then implement a function that will remove the newline character at the end of fgets. We then lay the groundwork for creating rooms in our game. </p>
