	<h1>Project: Text Adventure</h1>
	<p>In this project we'll write our first game, a classic text adventure game. Text adventures were one of the first video games & have a historic place both in computer game history & computer science history.</p>

	<h2>Lesson 0: Writing the <b>entry point</b> to our program</h2>
		<p>In this lesson we setup a new project, add the <b>main</b> entry point to our program, make use of the printf & scanf functions & add a while loop (commonly called the game loop) that will keep our program running. We will also implement our own string match function, to see if two strings equal each other.</p>
